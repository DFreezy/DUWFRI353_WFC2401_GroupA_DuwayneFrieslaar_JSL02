Hi. My name is Duwayne Frieslaar. 
I have found a solution to the duplication problem in this fitness tracker app. 
Just was a great challenge for me. Not to hard, but also not too easy. I feel it really elevated my growth in understanding the challenging parts
I entered the appropriate comments, and fixed the problem with the if function, as well as convering the list to an array so I could have better control over it.
Needless to say, it turned very good. I might use it myself.
